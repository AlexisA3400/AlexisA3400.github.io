Most Recent Project

**Flask-Based User Registration System**  
I recently collaborated with teammates to develop a comprehensive user registration system using Flask. This web application features secure user authentication, profile management, and database integration. The project involved implementing form validation, password hashing, and session management to create a robust and secure user experience. This project was a collaboration between Niket Gupta, Joseph Mascardo, John Gleiter, and myself: Alexis Alejandro
