About Me
======
My name is Alexis Alejandro, currently I am a senior at the University of Houston. Over my time at the university I have worked on many projects some of which may be found on this website. While studying here, I have decided to pursue a career in software engineering and software design. This website will continue to be populated with any future endeavors I will participate in.

Most Recent Project
======
**Flask-Based User Registration System**  
I recently collaborated with teammates to develop a comprehensive user registration system using Flask. This web application features secure user authentication, profile management, and database integration. The project involved implementing form validation, password hashing, and session management to create a robust and secure user experience. I would also like to thank my teammates for an amazing experience on this project. This project was a collaboration between Niket Gupta, Joseph Mascardo, John Gleiter, and myself: Alexis Alejandro.
